# Creating-Linux-shell-in-C

In this project, we have created a linux shell using C programming language. An operating
system is made of two major components – a shell and a kernel. A Kernel is at the nucleus of
a computer. It makes the communication between the hardware and software possible. While
the Kernel is the innermost part of an operating system, a shell is the outermost one.
The shell is a program that interacts with the user through a terminal or takes the input from a file and 
executes a sequence of commands that are passed to the Operating System. It is typically used
to allow users to run other programs in a friendly environment, often offering features such as
command history and job control. Shells are also interpreters, running programs written using
the shell’s language (shell scripts). In this project , we are going to implement several linux
commands in C language and create a shell by analysizing the entire process of shell scripting
and parsing commands.
